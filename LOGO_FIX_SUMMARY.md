# Logo Update Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## The Problem You Reported
When you updated your Clerk organization logo, existing interviews still showed the old logo on the interview call page.

## Root Cause
The system was storing the Clerk logo URL in the database when interviews were created, but it wasn't:
1. Syncing updates to the organization logo in the database
2. Dynamically fetching the latest logo for interviews without custom uploads

## The Solution

### 1. **Auto-Sync Organization Logos** 
Your organization's `image_url` in the database now automatically syncs with Clerk whenever you:
- Visit the dashboard
- View any interview details page
- Access any page that loads organization data

**Files Updated:**
- `src/services/clients.service.ts` - Now accepts and syncs `organization_image_url`
- `src/contexts/clients.context.tsx` - Passes Clerk's `organization.imageUrl` 
- `src/app/(client)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Syncs logo on dashboard load
- `src/app/(client)/interviews/[interviewId]/page.tsx` - Syncs logo on interview view

### 2. **Dynamic Logo Fetching**
The interview call page now distinguishes between:
- **Custom logos** (uploaded files in Supabase) - Never change
- **Organization logos** (from Clerk) - Always fetched fresh from database

**Files Updated:**
- `src/lib/storage.ts` - Added `isCustomLogoUpload()` utility to detect custom uploads
- `src/services/clients.service.ts` - Added `getOrganizationLogoById()` to fetch org logo
- `src/components/call/index.tsx` - Fetches latest org logo if no custom logo exists

### 3. **Smart Logo Display Priority**
```
1st Priority: Custom uploaded logo (if exists)
    ‚Üì
2nd Priority: Latest organization logo from database (synced with Clerk)
    ‚Üì
3rd Priority: UserIcon SVG (fallback if nothing else)
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Interview with NO Custom Logo
1. You create an interview ‚Üí Org logo URL stored in database
2. Interview page displays ‚Üí Fetches LATEST org logo from database
3. You update Clerk org logo ‚Üí Database syncs next time you visit dashboard
4. Interview page refreshed ‚Üí Shows NEW logo automatically! üéâ

### Scenario 2: Interview with Custom Logo
1. You upload a custom logo ‚Üí Stored in Supabase
2. Interview page displays ‚Üí Shows custom logo (ignores org logo)
3. You update Clerk org logo ‚Üí Custom logo unchanged (as intended)
4. Interview page refreshed ‚Üí Still shows custom logo ‚úì

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix:
1. **Create a test interview** without uploading a custom logo
2. **Open the interview call page** and note the current logo
3. **Go to Clerk Dashboard** and update your organization logo
4. **Visit your dashboard** once (to trigger the sync)
5. **Refresh the interview call page** ‚Üí You should see the NEW logo! ‚úÖ

### Test Custom Logos Still Work:
1. **Edit an interview** and upload a custom logo
2. **Update your Clerk org logo** to something different
3. **View that interview** ‚Üí Should still show custom logo (not org logo) ‚úì

## Why This is Better

### Before:
‚ùå Logos were saved once at interview creation
‚ùå Updating Clerk logo didn't affect existing interviews  
‚ùå Had to manually edit each interview to update logos

### After:
‚úÖ Logos sync automatically with Clerk
‚úÖ All non-custom interviews show latest org logo
‚úÖ Custom logos remain unchanged (as expected)
‚úÖ Zero maintenance required!

## Notes

- Organization logo sync happens automatically - no manual action needed
- The first visit to dashboard after updating Clerk logo will trigger the sync
- Custom logos are never auto-updated (stored permanently in Supabase)
- Changes propagate within seconds of visiting any dashboard page
- No database migration needed - works with existing data

## Summary

**The fix ensures your Clerk organization logo stays in sync across all interviews that don't have custom logos, while preserving custom logos for interviews where you specifically uploaded one.**

You now have the best of both worlds:
- üåç Global branding via Clerk that updates everywhere
- üé® Per-interview custom logos when you need them
